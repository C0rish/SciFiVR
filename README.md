# SciFiVR

This ist not a real "game" (yet?), its just an environment I wanted to share with you guys, my first VR "playground"<br><br>

It's my first try with a high-res VR (Quest only) environment, based on the unreal engine. Took me one day to composit / build, with everything you can see and hear (meshes, lighning, sounds).<br>
Meshes are from the "scifi kitbash level builder" package from the UE4 market store, sounds are royalty free sounds.<br><br>

I got really impressed with the first results, so maybe I'll add some enemies around the corners in the near future and create a little arcade shooter from it (if the performance is stable enough).<br>
Here and then I will add some stuff, just to play around and see how it behaves in VR.<br><br>

Currently there is no support for locomotion (the environment is not designed to walk, but you can use your real feet to walk some steps around)<br>

And as I said, just an (yet unfinished) experiment / playground...<br><br><br>


---------- Possible plans for the future ----------<br>
- Enemies + Laser Rifle?<br>
- Cargo Boxes to hide while shooting<br>
- <s>Triggerable (intruder) alarm with sound & light change</s><br>
- Longer corridor (when enemies are part of the game)
